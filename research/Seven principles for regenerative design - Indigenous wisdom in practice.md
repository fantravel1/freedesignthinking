# Seven principles for regenerative design: Indigenous wisdom in practice

**Indigenous design traditions offer more than inspiration—they provide tested frameworks for creative practice that honors relationships, embraces responsibility, and designs for thriving rather than mere survival. This synthesis distills millennia of Indigenous wisdom into seven actionable principles for young designers seeking alternatives to extractive, individualistic approaches.**

Contemporary design education often treats creativity as an individual capacity to be unlocked through workshops and certifications. Indigenous traditions across the globe offer a radically different vision: creativity as relational practice, emerging from connections to land, ancestors, community, and future generations. These are not primitive precursors to "real" design but sophisticated parallel systems with demonstrated outcomes—Indigenous peoples have protected 80% of global biodiversity while occupying only 20-25% of Earth's land surface.

This research synthesizes insights from African Ubuntu philosophy, Haudenosaunee Seven Generations thinking, Māori kaitiakitanga, Andean ayni, Japanese wabi-sabi, and numerous other traditions into seven principles that any designer can begin practicing today. These principles do not require appropriating specific cultural practices but rather adopting orientations that many Indigenous scholars have offered to the wider world.

## Principle One: Design with seven generations, not seven sprints

### The temporal horizon shapes everything

The **Haudenosaunee (Iroquois) Confederacy** encoded long-term thinking in their Great Law: every decision must relate to "the welfare and well-being of the seventh generation to come." Chief **Oren Lyons** of the Onondaga Nation explains: "We are looking ahead, as is one of the first mandates given us as chiefs, to make sure and to make every decision that we make relate to the welfare and well-being of the seventh generation to come."

This approximately **150-year** time horizon contrasts starkly with design thinking's emphasis on rapid iteration, quarterly metrics, and minimum viable products. Mohawk scholar **Scott Manning Stevens** clarifies the ethical dimension: "The Haudenosaunee concept of the Seventh Generation 'makes us be responsible.' Our relationship to land has much more to do with responsibility than rights."

### Practical application: The temporal audit

Before beginning any design project, ask:
- **What materials am I using, and where will they be in 150 years?**
- **Who will inherit the consequences of this design?**
- **Am I solving a problem or creating new ones for future generations?**
- **Would I be proud to explain this choice to my great-great-great-great-grandchildren?**

The Māori concept of **kaitiakitanga** (guardianship) reinforces this: leaving environments "in equal or better state for future generations." This is not abstract environmentalism but practical design methodology—every choice carries forward in time.

**Contemporary example**: The **Long Now Foundation** applies seven-generations thinking through projects like the 10,000 Year Clock, designed to tick for ten millennia. Their principle: "The Long Now is a recognition that the acceleration of technology requires our thinking to stretch correspondingly."

## Principle Two: Replace the genius myth with relational creativity

### You are not the source—you are a node in a network

Western design celebrates individual genius: the visionary designer whose creativity flows from personal inspiration. African **Ubuntu** philosophy offers a fundamental reorientation. The Nguni Bantu expression "Umuntu ngumuntu ngabantu" translates as "A person is a person through other persons." Archbishop **Desmond Tutu** articulated: "I am human because I belong, I participate, I share."

While Descartes grounded Western epistemology in individual cognition (*Cogito ergo sum*—"I think therefore I am"), Ubuntu proposes *Cognatus ergo sum* ("I am related, therefore I exist"). Professor **Richie Moalosi** of the University of Botswana developed *African Industrial Design Practice* demonstrating how empathy rooted in Ubuntu principles creates more successful products than persona-centered Western methods.

Scholar **Shawn Wilson** articulates the epistemological shift: "The importance of relationships, or relationality of an Indigenous ontology and epistemology... it's built upon the interconnections, the interrelationships, and that binds the group." This includes relationships with people, land, ancestors, water, and more-than-human entities as parts of an indivisible whole.

### Practical application: The relational inventory

Before claiming credit for a design, trace its relational network:
- **Whose knowledge made this possible?** (Teachers, mentors, traditions)
- **Whose labor supports this work?** (Material producers, supply chains)
- **Whose land provides the resources?** (Geographic and ecological contexts)
- **Whose community will be affected?** (Stakeholders beyond users)
- **Whose future depends on these choices?** (Downstream consequences)

This shifts design from "my creative vision" to "our collective making."

**Contemporary example**: The **Design Justice Network** (founded 2015, nearly 3,000 signatories) articulates: "We center the voices of those who are directly impacted by the outcomes of the design process" and "We see the role of the designer as a facilitator rather than an expert."

## Principle Three: Embrace imperfection as wisdom, not weakness

### The crack is where the light enters

Japanese aesthetic philosophy **wabi-sabi** emerged from 15th-century tea ceremony culture and finds beauty in impermanence, imperfection, and incompleteness. Author **Leonard Koren** identifies three core principles: nothing lasts, nothing is finished, nothing is perfect. This directly challenges Western design's pursuit of flawless, timeless forms.

**Kintsugi** (金継ぎ—"golden joinery") extends this philosophy to repair: broken pottery is mended with lacquer mixed with powdered gold, making damage visible rather than concealed. Scholar **Christy Bartlett** writes: "Not only is there no attempt to hide the damage, but the repair is literally illuminated... The vicissitudes of existence over time, to which all humans are susceptible, could not be clearer."

The Navajo **ch'ihónít'i** (spirit line) represents a similar wisdom: "a purposeful line woven into many Navajo textiles"—a thin line extending from center to edge that disentangles weavers from completed work. Perfection would trap the weaver's spirit in the textile forever.

### Practical application: The imperfection practice

Deliberately introduce elements that acknowledge incompleteness:
- **Leave space for evolution.** Design systems that can be added to, not finished objects.
- **Document your learning.** Show the iterations, not just the polished final.
- **Repair visibly.** When something breaks, fix it in ways that honor its history.
- **Release attachment.** Know when to complete work rather than perfect it.

This philosophy connects to **mottainai** (regret over waste) and offers an alternative to planned obsolescence: repair as enhancement rather than concealment.

**Contemporary example**: The **Repair Café** movement, started in Amsterdam in 2009, now includes over 2,500 locations worldwide where volunteers repair broken items together—making repair visible, communal, and celebrated rather than hidden or outsourced.

## Principle Four: Make reciprocity your design methodology

### Every taking requires giving back

The Quechua principle of **ayni**—"Today for you, tomorrow for me"—establishes reciprocity as foundational to all relationships. This extends beyond human exchange to **Pachamama** (Mother Earth) and **Apus** (mountain spirits): "When you give something, you are entitled to get something back, and when you get something you have an obligation to reciprocate and give something back."

**Robin Wall Kimmerer** (Citizen Potawatomi Nation, SUNY Distinguished Teaching Professor, 2022 MacArthur Fellow) codifies this as the **Honorable Harvest**: take only what is given, use everything taken, give thanks, reciprocate the gift. Her work is "an invitation into reciprocity." This extends to materials, communities, and ecosystems: design should give back for what it receives.

Ecuadorian **Sumak Kawsay** (Quechua for "Good Living") and Bolivian **Suma Qamaña** (Aymara) propose "collective harmonious life based on ethical values rather than endless capital accumulation." Both Ecuador (2008) and Bolivia (2009) incorporated these principles constitutionally, including rights of nature.

### Practical application: The reciprocity audit

For every design decision, trace the exchanges:
- **What am I taking?** (Materials, labor, attention, data, cultural knowledge)
- **From whom or what am I taking?** (Communities, ecosystems, traditions)
- **What am I giving back?** (Value, resources, opportunities, restoration)
- **Is the exchange equitable?** (Who benefits most? Who bears costs?)
- **How can I increase the give relative to the take?**

This transforms extractive design into regenerative practice.

**Contemporary example**: The **Perennial** restaurant in San Francisco operated on principles of "reciprocity with nature," sourcing from regenerative farms and returning food waste as compost. Though it closed in 2018, its model influenced sustainable restaurant design globally.

## Principle Five: Learn through mastery before innovation

### Respect tradition as foundation, not limitation

The Japanese **Shu-Ha-Ri** (守破離) framework describes three stages of learning:
- **Shu** (protect/obey): Follow forms exactly without deviation
- **Ha** (break/detach): Question and experiment after deep understanding
- **Ri** (leave/transcend): Depart from forms to create from internalized wisdom

Aikido master **Endō Seishirō** explains: "In shu, we repeat the forms and discipline ourselves so that our bodies absorb the forms that our forebears created... In ha, once we have disciplined ourselves to acquire the forms and movements, we make innovations. Finally, in ri, we completely depart from the forms, open the door to creative technique, and arrive in a place where we act in accordance with what our heart/mind desires."

Haida artist **Robert Davidson** describes the equivalent in Northwest Coast formline design: "Once one masters the alphabet of Northwest Coast art, the challenge is to move beyond copying and make the art yours. After **10,000 hours** of practice and copying, then intuition kicks in."

This contrasts with Western design education's emphasis on "finding your voice" and personal expression before mastering foundational knowledge. The Akan principle of **Sankofa**—symbolized by a bird walking forward with its head turned backward—teaches that "It is not wrong to go back for that which you have forgotten."

### Practical application: The mastery pathway

Structure learning in three phases:
1. **Absorb** (Years 1-3): Copy masters. Learn rules completely. Suspend judgment.
2. **Question** (Years 4-6): Experiment within tradition. Understand why rules exist.
3. **Transcend** (Year 7+): Create original work from internalized principles.

This is not about suppressing creativity but building the foundation from which genuine innovation emerges.

**Contemporary example**: **Andile Dyalvane**, South African ceramicist, explains: "Culturally, traditionally, and in African spirituality... we relate to the past, so the present can prepare the future." His internationally celebrated work emerges from deep grounding in Xhosa traditions.

## Principle Six: Design as healing, not just problem-solving

### Making can mend what is broken

Indigenous traditions worldwide recognize creativity as medicine. The **Indigenous Healing Arts Alliance** addresses "Reverse Intergenerational & Historical Trauma" through art therapy programs. A 2024 systematic review found that **all 19 studies** of crafts-based interventions in Indigenous communities reported improvements in anxiety, stress, depression, self-efficacy, and well-being.

Navajo weaving philosophy embodies this understanding: "In Navajo beliefs, thoughts, desires, and prayers are tangible objects that can have lasting effects on the material world. While weaving, the artist entwines part of her being into her work." The central concept of **hózhó**—harmony, balance, beauty—represents the goal of all making.

Oaxacan **comunalidad** includes ritual and ceremony as essential to collective making. Mixe intellectual **Floriberto Díaz Gómez** identified fiesta as one of five foundational elements of community alongside territory, assembly, service, and collective work. Making is never merely functional—it serves spiritual, social, and healing purposes simultaneously.

### Practical application: The healing intention

Before beginning any project, ask:
- **What is wounded here that might be healed?** (Community, environment, relationships, self)
- **What wholeness am I working toward?**
- **How does the process of making contribute to healing?**
- **Who might be harmed, and how can I prevent that?**
- **What ceremonies or rituals support this work?**

This expands design's purpose from solving problems to restoring wholeness.

**Contemporary example**: **Indigenous Architecture and Design Victoria** (founded by **Jefa Greenaway**, Wailwan and Gamillaraay) approaches built environments as sites of healing from colonial trauma, incorporating traditional knowledge, natural materials, and community connection.

## Principle Seven: Hold knowledge collectively, not individually

### Wisdom belongs to the community

Northwest Coast formline design includes sophisticated intellectual property systems predating Western IP law by millennia. "A clan is the basic social unit in Tlingit, Haida and Tsimshian societies. The clan is the unit that owns property. This property is called **Haa At.óowu** in Tlingit. At.óow includes physical property; land, songs, names, stories, and crests."

Oaxacan **comunalidad** comprises communal territory, consensual decision-making, voluntary service, collective work (**tequio**), and ritual. Zapotec anthropologist **Jaime Martínez Luna** explains: "To understand comunalidad... is to have a communal attitude. What is a communal attitude? It is in principle respecting the other, knowing that you are not without the other and the other." Today, **417 of Oaxaca's 570 municipalities** are governed by Indigenous normative systems.

**Tyson Yunkaporta** introduces **yarning** (Aboriginal group dialogue based on mutual respect, active listening, and humor) and **relational knowledge** (knowledge created in relation, not held individually). His definition: "A member of a community retaining memories of life lived sustainably on a land-base, as part of that land-base."

### Practical application: The collective holding

Structure creative work for communal benefit:
- **Share process, not just products.** Document and teach methods openly.
- **Credit expansively.** Acknowledge all who contributed, including ancestors and traditions.
- **Build commons.** Create resources that benefit communities beyond yourself.
- **Seek consent.** Before using cultural knowledge, ask permission and offer reciprocity.
- **Return value.** Ensure benefits flow back to source communities.

This transforms design from competitive advantage to collective wealth.

**Contemporary example**: The **International Indigenous Design Charter** (launched 2016) provides protocols for working with Indigenous knowledge, emphasizing self-determination, environmental protection, and respect "over deep time: past, present and future."

## Applying the seven principles: A practice framework

### Daily practice

**Morning intention**: Which principle needs attention today? Set an intention before beginning work.

**Process check**: Pause mid-project to assess alignment:
- Am I thinking long-term or chasing immediate results?
- Am I acknowledging relationships or claiming individual credit?
- Am I embracing imperfection or pursuing impossible polish?
- Am I giving back as much as I take?
- Am I building on tradition or ignoring what came before?
- Am I designing for healing or just solving problems?
- Am I sharing knowledge or hoarding advantage?

**Evening reflection**: What did I learn? Where did I fall short? What will I do differently tomorrow?

### Project-level integration

At project start:
1. **Temporal mapping**: Trace impacts across seven generations
2. **Relational inventory**: Identify all stakeholders and relationships
3. **Reciprocity plan**: Define what you will give back
4. **Tradition research**: Study relevant precedents and knowledge systems
5. **Healing intention**: Articulate what wholeness you seek
6. **Collective benefit**: Plan how knowledge will be shared

At project completion:
1. **Temporal review**: Assess long-term impacts honestly
2. **Relational acknowledgment**: Credit all contributions expansively
3. **Reciprocity fulfillment**: Ensure you gave back as promised
4. **Tradition documentation**: Record what you learned for others
5. **Healing assessment**: Evaluate contribution to wholeness
6. **Knowledge sharing**: Release learnings to the commons

## These principles require genuine commitment

### Extraction disguised as appreciation helps no one

Learning from Indigenous design requires what scholar **Marie Battiste** describes as engagement "not from reading academic articles" but through Indigenous mentorship, time commitment, and ongoing responsibility. Practitioners must maintain openness that preserves complexity rather than reframing within Western frameworks.

The **Design Justice Network** establishes clear protocols: designers should recognize when a project is not theirs to take, promote more appropriate people when needed, help fund marginalized communities' efforts, and work with minority-owned suppliers. Before seeking new solutions, practitioners should "look for what is already working at the community level" and "honor and uplift traditional, indigenous, and local knowledge and practices."

**Arturo Escobar** warns that design can either perpetuate colonial extraction or be "redirected toward other ontological commitments"—toward healing the web of life. The choice is not neutral.

### The difference between appreciation and appropriation

Appreciation:
- Credits sources explicitly and expansively
- Seeks permission and ongoing consent
- Returns value to source communities
- Maintains complexity and context
- Supports Indigenous-led initiatives
- Acknowledges limitations of understanding

Appropriation:
- Claims inspiration without attribution
- Takes without asking
- Extracts value without reciprocity
- Simplifies for convenience
- Centers non-Indigenous designers
- Assumes understanding is complete

## Conclusion: From principles to practice

Indigenous design traditions offer not exotic inspiration to consume but rigorous alternative frameworks for creative practice. The seven principles—temporal depth, relational creativity, embracing imperfection, practicing reciprocity, learning through mastery, designing for healing, and holding knowledge collectively—represent tested methodologies with demonstrated outcomes across millennia.

For young designers seeking alternatives to extractive, individualistic approaches, these principles provide a foundation for genuinely regenerative practice. They require commitment: slowing down, acknowledging relationships, giving back, learning traditions before innovating, healing rather than just solving, and sharing rather than hoarding.

The practical efficacy of these systems is demonstrated: Indigenous peoples have protected 80% of global biodiversity. Polynesian navigators crossed oceans using traditional wayfinding. Aboriginal Songlines encode ecological knowledge enabling survival across Australia's harshest environments for 65,000+ years. These are not primitive alternatives but sophisticated systems offering urgent wisdom.

As the Zapatistas articulate: **"Un mundo donde quepan muchos mundos"**—a world where many worlds fit. The pluriverse already exists in the ongoing practices of Indigenous communities worldwide. The invitation is to learn respectfully, practice consistently, and design for thriving across all generations yet to come.
